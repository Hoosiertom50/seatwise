# Seatwise

Wedding seating & table assignment planner — build a guest list, define who has to (or can't)
sit together, and generate a seating chart that respects every rule.

This repo is the first working slice of Seatwise: account signup/login, creating a wedding,
managing its guest list, defining seating rules between guests, and setting up tables. It's
built to grow into the full feature set described in the requirements doc and tracked in Jira
(TS-2 through TS-15) without a rewrite, and to make an eventual iOS/Android app a thin addition
rather than a second project.

## Stack

- **Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind** for the web app — one codebase, server and
  client, deployed as a single app.
- **PostgreSQL** for the database — see `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma` for the full data
  model (accounts, weddings, guests, seating rules, tables, plan versions & history, rule
  weighting config). Only the pieces this first slice uses (users, weddings, guests) are wired
  up to the API yet; the rest of the schema is there so later stories are additive.
- **JWT-based auth**, not cookie-only sessions — the web app stores the token in an httpOnly
  cookie, but every `/api/v1/*` endpoint also accepts `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. A future
  mobile app authenticates against the exact same endpoints and stores the token itself; nothing
  about auth needs to change when that app gets built.
- **A REST API under `/api/v1/`** is the only thing either client talks to. The web app happens
  to be Next.js, but the mobile app doesn't need to know that — it just needs an HTTP client and
  a place to keep a token.

## Repo layout

```
apps/web/            Next.js app — pages + /api/v1 route handlers
packages/shared/      Zod schemas & shared TS types (validation rules, DTOs) — importable by
                       the web app today and a React Native/Expo app later, unchanged
packages/db/           Data model (Prisma schema) + the query layer the API routes use
```

## Getting started (on your own machine)

Prerequisites: Node 20+, pnpm (`corepack enable` will get you the right version), and a
PostgreSQL server (local install, Docker, or a hosted one like Supabase/Neon).

```bash
pnpm install
```

Create `apps/web/.env` (copy `.env.example` at the repo root):

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/seatwise_dev?schema=public"
JWT_SECRET="a long random string"
```

Apply the database schema. On a normal machine, Prisma's CLI will download what it needs on
first run:

```bash
cd packages/db
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Then from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

and open http://localhost:3000 — sign up, create a wedding, add some guests, and try the
Seating rules and Tables tabs on a wedding's page.

### A note on how the database layer was built and verified here

The sandbox this was built in blocks outbound network access to Prisma's binary CDN
(`binaries.prisma.sh`), which `prisma generate` / `prisma migrate dev` need even just to read a
schema — so neither could run inside this environment, full stop, regardless of database
credentials. That's specific to this sandbox, not to Postgres or to your machine; it'll very
likely just work when you run the commands above.

To still build and *verify* a real, running app inside that constraint, the initial schema was
applied by hand: `packages/db/prisma/migrations/0001_init/migration.sql` is a plain SQL file
that matches `schema.prisma` table-for-table, applied directly with `psql`. The API routes talk
to Postgres through the `pg` driver directly (`packages/db/src/queries/*.ts`) rather than through
a generated Prisma Client. The full signup → create wedding → add/edit/remove guest flow was
tested end-to-end against a local Postgres this way, including both the cookie-auth and
Bearer-token auth paths.

`schema.prisma` stays the source of truth for the data model either way. Once you run
`prisma migrate dev` on your machine (or in CI), Prisma will want to create its own migration
history; either let it do that fresh, or run `npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 0001_init`
first so it recognizes the hand-applied migration as already done. If you'd rather adopt Prisma
Client for the query layer instead of the current `pg`-based one, that's a reasonable next step
once `prisma generate` can run — the schema and `@prisma/adapter-pg` (already installed) are set
up for it.

## What's implemented

- Email/password signup and login, JWT issued on both, session check endpoint.
- Create/list weddings, scoped to the signed-in owner.
- Add/list/update (RSVP status)/remove guests within a wedding, with tier, party/household
  grouping, headcount, and an accessible-table flag.
- Seating rules between guests (must sit together / must not sit together / prefer near / avoid),
  with the FR-0.1 hard-rule invariant enforced server-side: a pair of guests can't simultaneously
  be required to sit together and forbidden from it — that's blocked outright with a clear error,
  not just left to the UI to prevent.
- Tables: create/update/delete tables for a wedding with a name, seat capacity, optional purpose
  (e.g. "Kids table"), a restricted flag, and an accessible-seating flag. (A visual drag-and-drop
  floor plan is a follow-on enhancement — this pass is the data layer plus a straightforward
  list-based UI.)
- **Automated seat assignment engine** (TS-8): a "Generate new plan" button on a wedding's
  Seating plan tab groups guests into tables, respecting every hard rule and never silently
  breaking one:
  - Guests forced together by "must sit together" (including chains — if A must sit with B, and
    B must sit with C, all three are kept together as one unit) always land at the same table.
  - Guests with a "must not sit together" rule are never placed at the same table as each
    other — whether or not they're in the same forced-together unit — and a rule that's flatly
    unsatisfiable (e.g. A-B and B-C are forced together, but A-C also must not sit together) is
    rejected outright before anything is saved, with a clear explanation of the conflict.
  - A guest who needs an accessible table is only ever placed at one flagged as accessible.
  - Table capacity is a hard limit — a table is never overbooked.
  - "Prefer near" / "avoid" are treated as soft, best-effort preferences: honored when there's
    room to do so, and surfaced as a non-blocking warning (naming the guests involved) when they
    can't be.
  - If there isn't a valid seat for everyone (not enough capacity, or every remaining table
    already seats someone a guest must not sit with), the plan is generated anyway, those guests
    are listed as unassigned with a clear reason, and the plan is marked incomplete — nothing is
    ever guessed or silently dropped.
  - Every generation creates a new numbered version; past versions stay viewable from the
    dropdown on the Seating plan tab.
  - Restricted tables (a specific required guest list, e.g. a reserved family table) are left
    out of automatic assignment for now — the schema tracks the flag, but seating those is a
    manual/later step, since a per-table required-guest list isn't modeled yet.
- Every list/detail endpoint enforces ownership — you can't read or modify another account's
  wedding, guests, rules, tables, or plan versions by guessing an ID, and a seating rule can't be
  created between guests from two different weddings even if you have access to both.

## What's next

Table/venue *visual* layout (drag-and-drop floor plan) and review/approval, manual adjustment,
day-of mode, export/print, collaboration, and richer plan-versioning (labeling/comparing/rolling
back versions) are modeled in `schema.prisma` already and map to the remaining Jira stories
(TS-7's visual piece, TS-9 through TS-15). Each can be built as its own vertical slice on top of
this foundation.

## Mobile later

Nothing here should need to change to add an iOS/Android app: point a React Native/Expo app (or
a Capacitor-wrapped build of this same web app, if that's the faster route when the time comes)
at the same `/api/v1` endpoints, reuse `@seatwise/shared` for validation and types, and store the
token from the auth response instead of relying on the cookie.
